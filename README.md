# Buld Website Builder Template

Default starter used by the Buld website builder. This template is set up for fast UI development with a modern Next.js stack.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- Lucide icons
- Geist font via `next/font`

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Notes:
- Run `pnpm start` after `pnpm build`.
- This repo uses pnpm (see `packageManager` in `package.json`).
